# Overview
Playwright is an open-source automation framework that is used for testing web applications. It allows you to automate browser interactions and provides a robust, reliable, and fast way to test modern web applications across different browsers, including Chromium (Chrome, Edge), Firefox, and WebKit (Safari).

## What Is Playwright?
Built by Microsoft, Playwright is a Node.js library that, with a single API, automates websites and web apps running on Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit. These APIs can be used by developers writing JavaScript code to create new browser pages, navigate to URLs, and then interact with elements on a page. 

In addition, since Microsoft Edge is built on the open-source Chromium web platform, Playwright can also automate Microsoft Edge.

Playwright launches a **headless browser** by default. The command line is the only way to use a headless browser, as it does not display a UI. Playwright also supports running full (non-headless) Microsoft Edge.

## Why Use Playwright for Web Automation?
Playwright stands out due to its cross-browser, cross-platform, and cross-language capabilities.

Here’s why it’s a popular choice:

- **Broad Compatibility**: Playwright works with all major browsers (Chromium, WebKit, Firefox) on Windows, Linux, and macOS and supports multiple programming languages like Java, JavaScript, Python, and .NET, offering a unified API for automation.
- **Resilient and Flaky-Test Resistant**: Playwright’s auto-wait feature automatically waits for elements to become actionable, reducing flakiness. Its web-first assertions and retry logic help ensure tests are reliable without needing manual timeouts.
- **Complete Test Isolation**: Each test runs in a separate browser context, simulating a brand-new browser profile, which ensures no interference between tests. You can save authentication states, avoiding repeated logins while keeping tests independent.
- **Advanced Testing Scenarios**: Playwright allows testing of complex workflows involving multiple tabs, users, or contexts and can interact with shadow DOM elements and dynamic content using real browser inputs, mimicking genuine user actions.
- **Robust Debugging and Tools**: With features like the Playwright Inspector, Codegen, and Trace Viewer, you can easily create, inspect, and debug tests. These tools provide comprehensive insights into test execution, complete with videos, screenshots, and DOM snapshots.

## Playwright Architecture
To understand how Playwright's architecture works, we will compare its work with that of Selenium.

Selenium sends each command as an independent HTTP request and receives JSON responses. Each interaction, such as opening a browser window, clicking an element, or entering text into an input box, is then sent as a separate HTTP request.

This means we have to wait longer for responses and increases the chances of errors.

In contrast, Playwright communicates over WebSocket, allowing faster and more reliable communication between the test script and the browser. This architecture improves performance and reduces the likelihood of flaky tests.
